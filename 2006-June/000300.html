+Sound (prompt) and Music On Hold files:
+
+Beginning with Asterisk 1.4, the sound files and music on hold files supplied for
+use with Asterisk have been replaced with new versions produced from high quality
+master recordings, and are available in three languages (English, French and
+Spanish) and in five formats (WAV (uncompressed), mu-Law, a-Law, GSM and G.729).
+In addition, the music on hold files provided by FreePlay Music are now available
+in the same five formats, but no longer available in MP3 format.
+
+The Asterisk 1.4 tarball packages will only include English prompts in GSM format,
+(as were supplied with previous releases) and the FreePlay MOH files in WAV format.
+All of the other variations can be installed by running 'make menuselect' and
+selecting the packages you wish to install; when you run 'make install', those
+packages will be downloaded and installed along with the standard files included
+in the tarball.
+
+If for some reason you expect to not have Internet access at the time you will be
+running 'make install', you can make your package selections using menuselect and
+then run 'make sounds' to download (only) the sound packages; this will leave the
+sound packages in the 'sounds' subdirectory to be used later during installation.
+
+WARNING: Asterisk 1.4 supports a new layout for sound files in multiple languages;
+instead of the alternate-language files being stored in subdirectories underneath
+the existing files (for French, that would be digits/fr, letters/fr, phonetic/fr,
+etc.) the new layout creates one directory under /var/lib/asterisk/sounds for the
+language itself, then places all the sound files for that language under that
+directory and its subdirectories. This is the layout that will be created if you
+select non-English languages to be installed via menuselect, HOWEVER Asterisk does
+not default to this layout and will not find the files in the places it expects them
+to be. If you wish to use this layout, make sure you put 'languageprefix=yes' in your
+/etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf file, so that Asterisk will know how the files were
+installed.

-* The phonetic sounds directory has been removed from the asterisk-sounds
-  package because they are now included directly in Asterisk.  However, it is
-  important to note that the phonetic sounds that existed in asterisk-sounds 
-  used a different naming convention than the sounds in Asterisk.  For example,
-  instead of alpha.gsm and bravo.gsm, Asterisk has a_p.gsm and b_p.gsm.
